# :rocket: Projects
* **StudyBuddies:**
  A web application designed to help students form study groups based on their majors.
  * Key features include:
    * Account Creation & Login: Users can create accounts with emails ending in "@uncc.edu" and must have a password of at least 8 characters. Passwords are hashed for security.
    * Personalized Home Page: Users select their major after logging in and are welcomed by name on their homepage. They can update their major, access discussion pages, and adjust settings.
    * Discussion Pages: Users can post, update, like, or dislike messages in both major-specific and general discussion pages. Posts are visible to all students in the same major and can be maintained if the user switches majors once.
    * Account Management: Users can sign out or delete their accounts, with the latter removing all associated data, including posts.
    * Extra Feature: Deployed using Render for cloud hosting.
